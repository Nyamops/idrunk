description=[h1]Immersive Medicine - extension of default medicine[/h1]
description=
description=Are you tired of the same type of meds?

description=[h1]Blood transfusion system[/h1]

description=[/list]
description=
description=Does the last point sound scary? Put the white slippers aside! Either stock up on blood packs of your group in advance, or ask your friend. Just be careful: suddenly he is infected or his group simply does not suit you.
description=
description=Becoming a donor is easy. You need: a blood testing kit, an empty blood bag, a catheter for intravenous transfusion. And a refrigerator. If you overdo it and you need to store a friend or blood bags somewhere.
description=[i]To perform a blood transfusion, you need to select either the right or left forearm in the health panel[/i]
